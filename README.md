# jaeger

Jaeger is a Swift library for the [Buildkite API](https://buildkite.com/docs/rest-api) using the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Buildkite API](https://buildkite.com/docs/rest-api) and [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager).

According to their GitHub integration [entry](https://github.com/integrations/buildkite): [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com) is a CI and build automation tool that combines the power of your own build infrastructure with the convenience of a managed, centralised web UI. The Buildkite open source agent is installable on any machine or network and provides a simple, repeatable process for running builds. And Buildkite's centralised web service handles agent monitoring, job distribution, integration with GitHub and Slack, and provides everyone on your team with an elegant interface for monitoring builds, tailing logs, and downloading artifacts.
